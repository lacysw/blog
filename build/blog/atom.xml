        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello, and welcome! You are currently reading my first &quot;official&quot; post here, having now fleshed out all of the necessary features of my new website, <em>swlacy.com</em>. This space is designed to fulfill my needs as a platform to publish technical content and reflect on my learning as a cybersecurity and political science student.</p><p>There is not any particular wealth of content as I write this blog submission; most notably, you may find more information about me <a href="/about-me">here</a> or view my first tutorial/walkthrough publication on HackTheBox&#x27;s Previse challenge <a href="/docs/reports/previse">here</a>, but that highlights the extent of my uploads so far.</p><p>I have been hard at work tuning this website and maintaining the WWU Cybersecurity Club over the 2021 holiday season; expect more articles and blog posts to appear soon enough.</p><p>Kind regards,<br/>
