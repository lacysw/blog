        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello, and welcome to my website. I&#x27;m glad you stopped by.</p><p>My name is Sid. I am a student at Western Washington University, currently majoring in cybersecurity and political science. I created <em>swlacy.com</em> to practice my web development skills and to provide myself a more elegant, professional location to publish work, which I can tailor to my specific needs. I intend for this space to become a trove of information others can use to learn from alongside myself. I am humbled by your interest in my page, and I hope you find something here that intrigues or helps you in some capacity.</p><p>While this site is not particularly dense in terms of posted content at the moment, regularly uploading new articles is a personal goal I have set for myself... If nothing interests you now, please revist soon to see new content.</p><p>I would love to connect with you — please, feel free to reach out to me for any reason via the links below:</p><p><a href="mailto:contact@swlacy.com?subject=Hello!">Email</a> • <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lacysw/">LinkedIn</a> • <a href="https://github.com/lacysw">GitHub</a></p>]]></content>
