As mentioned in the previous section, Ubuntu Server will be used to host the development environment. I write code regularly and host a variety of services on my local network, so I have a physical computer running Ubuntu Server on bare metal, which I use SSH to access. If you would also like to use Ubuntu (not required), you may do the same by following this guide or by creating a virtual instance using the hypervisor of your choice or Multipass. Alternatively, if you don\'t have access to another computer and cannot/would prefer not to use virtualization for whatever reason, you may use your physical computer.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"extended-tutorials/how-i-made-this-website/edit-defaults":{"id":"extended-tutorials/how-i-made-this-website/edit-defaults","title":"Editing Docusaurus Defaults","description":"This page is coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"extended-tutorials/how-i-made-this-website/introduction":{"id":"extended-tutorials/how-i-made-this-website/introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"This tutorial aims to serve as an introduction to hosting a simple personal website using a static site generator (because apparently there aren\u2019t enough of those already).
