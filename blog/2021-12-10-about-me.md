Hello, and welcome to my website. I'm glad you stopped by!

My name is Sid. I am a student at Western Washington University, currently majoring
in cybersecurity and political science. I created *swlacy.com* to practice my web
development skills and to provide myself a more elegant, professional location to publish
work, which I can tailor to my specific needs. I am humbled by your interest in my
page, and I hope you find something here that intrigues or helps you in some capacity.

While this site is not particularly dense in terms of posted content at the moment,
it is my intention to make positing here a regular occurance. Check back soon to see
more submissions.

I would love to connect with you — please, feel free to reach out to me for any reason
via the links below:
