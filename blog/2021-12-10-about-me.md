Hello, and welcome to my website. I'm glad you stopped by.

My name is Sid. I am a student at Western Washington University, currently majoring in cybersecurity and political science. I created *swlacy.com* to practice my web development skills and to provide myself a more elegant, professional location to publish work, which I can tailor to my specific needs. I intend for this space to become a trove of information others can use to learn from alongside myself. I am humbled by your interest in my page, and I hope you find something here that intrigues or helps you in some capacity.

While this site is not particularly dense in terms of posted content at the moment, regularly uploading new articles is a personal goal I have set for myself... If nothing interests you now, please revist soon to see new content.

I would love to connect with you — please, feel free to reach out to me for any reason via the links below:
