This space is designed to fulfill my needs as a platform to publish technical content and reflect on my learning as a cybersecurity and political science student.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\nThere is not any particular wealth of content as I write this blog submission; most notably, you may find more information about me [here](/about-me) or view my first tutorial/walkthrough publication on HackTheBox's Previse challenge [here](/docs/reports/previse), but that highlights the extent of my uploads so far.\n\nI have been hard at work tuning this website and maintaining the WWU Cybersecurity Club over the 2021 holiday season; expect more articles and blog posts to appear soon enough.\n\nKind regards,  \nSid Lacy  \n[Email](mailto:contact@swlacy.com?subject=Hello!) • [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lacysw/) • [GitHub](https://github.com/lacysw)"
