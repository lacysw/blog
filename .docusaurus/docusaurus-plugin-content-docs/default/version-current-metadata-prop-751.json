I write code regularly and host a variety of services on my local network, so I have a physical computer running Ubuntu Server on bare metal, which I use SSH to access. If you would also like to use Ubuntu (not required), you may do the same by following this guide or by creating a virtual instance using the hypervisor of your choice or Multipass. Alternatively, if you don't have access to another computer and cannot/would prefer not to use virtualization for whatever reason, you may use your physical computer.",
