  "description": "Of course, you can't reasonably develop a website without first configuring the tools to do so. As mentioned in the previous section, Ubuntu Server will be used to host the development environment. I write code regularly and host a variety of services on my local network, so I have a physical computer running Ubuntu Server on bare metal, which I use SSH to access. If you would also like to use Ubuntu on bare metal, you may do the same by following this guide or by creating a virtual instance using the hypervisor of your choice or Multipass (which is very simple). Alternatively, if you don't have access to another computer and cannot/would prefer not to use virtualization for whatever reason, you may use your physical computer, but note that all commands will assume use of Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS.",
