# About Me & My Goals for This Site

![Crater Lake](/img/craterLake.jpg "Crater Lake, OR; shot by me in the summer of 2021")
Hello, and welcome to my website. I'm glad you stopped by.

## Summary

> *Who are you?*

My name is Sid Lacy. I am a student at Western Washington University, double-majoring in cybersecurity and political science; I aspire to one day fill a role in my professional life that sees some intersection between the two. Currently, I also cohead and represent the [Western Washington University Cybersecurity Club](https://wwucyber.com) as a member of the Cybersecurity Department, working with my peers to spread awareness and discuss contemporary news related to cybersecurity, and to promote activity in security-related technical events.

> *What is this website?*

In my free time, I write here, populating this site with posts on my [blog](/blog) and publishing articles in the [Docs section](/docs), both of which have a general emphasis on the study of computer security (with some exceptions). My intention behind *swlacy.com* is two-sided: first, I use this space to enrich my knowledge, providing a more elegant, professional location to publish work, which I can tailor to my specific needs. Second, I aim for this space to be of equal use to others, to become a trove of information those interested in computer security can use to benefit from as well. Learning is for everyone — I am humbled by your interest in my page, and I hope you find something here that intrigues or helps you in some capacity.

While this site is not particularly dense in terms of posted content at the moment, regularly uploading new articles is a personal goal I have set for myself — if nothing interests you now, please revisit soon to see new submissions.

> *How can I contact you?*

Do you have feedback on an article I have published here? Would you like to work on a project together? Just want to chat? I am honored! You may reach out to me for any reason via [Email](mailto:contact@swlacy.com?subject=Hello!) (preferred) or connect over [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lacysw/).

Are you trying to speak to me in a professional capacity? Perhaps you would also like to see my [resume (PDF)](/resume.pdf). The LaTeX source code is hosted on GitHub under [lacysw/resume](https://github.com/lacysw/resume/blob/main/resume.tex).

## Qualifications
> *What gives you the right to post about security — do you even know what you're doing?*

Most of the time — after all, this site is dedicated to the application of personal learning, and I use it as such. Not always, but the content of my posts frequently illustrate the use of tools or methodologies I discover for myself while writing.
