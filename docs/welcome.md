# Welcome!
The *Documents* section hosts a growing number of technical articles, focused primarily on cybersecurity challenges (HackTheBox, TryHackMe, etc.) and miscellaneous development projects. While relatively sparse now, I intend to share much of my interesting activity here. If nothing immediately sparks your interest, please check back soon. The left-hand sidebar can be used to navigate between the pages of this section.

Questions, comments, or other feedback? [I can be reached over email](mailto:contact@swlacy.com).

Enjoy!
