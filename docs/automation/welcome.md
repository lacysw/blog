# Header
The *Automation* subsection contains a variety of short scripts I have written or modified both for personal use and team-based application during security competitions. Please note that there are also references to and inclusion of the work of others here; if I have not authored code under this section in its entirety, all other contributors are cited appropriately.

Questions, comments, or other feedback? [I can be reached over email](mailto:contact@swlacy.com).
